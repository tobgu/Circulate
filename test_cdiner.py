# TODO
# x - Write to excel
# - Measure time taken to loop and merge some of the loops
# x - Get the web interface working including subprocessing
# - ~ Measure the read in times and improve them if possible
# - Make some sort of validation of the generated data, writing down weights and reoccuring pairs?
# - Make it possible to start from a fixed position
# - Make it possible to lock certain individuals to certain positions and optimize from there
# - Dust of the table based algorithm to make it work over the whole conference
# - Print tables and participants ordered by the last or first name of the participant
# - Some sort if drag and drop HTML interface as a complement to the excel file delivered
#   for intermediate seating manipulation
