- Add techie numbers over number of switch attempts, number of actual
  swithes and number of scrambled conferences.
- Update and unify naming to call everything circular, also, drop the notion of tables and conference
  name it something more neutral or make it configurable.
- Create a wizard for filling in start data via a web interface (make
  it possible to use these dialogs to adjust the data)
- Styling, make uniform and make Circulate! the name to use
- Interaction and presentation, perhaps a tabbed interface with
  different types of data on the different tabs.
- Make it possible to take table/group size into account when
  calculating co-location count.
- Nicer input/error checking of the excel file
- No need to handle sessions or users, is there? Always send all data
  back and fourth + single page app.
- Create smaller services, excel parsing, optimization, web, more?
- Testing
- Try building a front end using react rather than angular
